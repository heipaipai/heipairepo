### [Costa-Gazc贸n 2021: Practical Threat Intelligence and Data-Driven Threat Hunting Chapter 4: Mapping the Adversary (sans Testing yourself)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-threat-intelligence/9781838556372/B13376_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-75)

* There is no threat hunting without good threat intelligence
* [MITRE ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/)
* ATT&CK Framework
  * descriptive model for labeling and studying activities that an attacker can do in order to access and operate inside a target system
  * provides a common taxonomy for adversary behaviours
  * can be used however the user wishes to
  * creation of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) sets on top of the framework is accepted (encouraged?); user-made TTPs can be contributed to the ATT&CK team
* 14 tactics used by the ATT&CK Framework
  1. Reconnaissance: gathering information about the victim(s)
  2. Resource Development: assessment of attacker resources
  3. Initial Access: how the attacker gets access in the victim environment
  4. Execution: running malicious code inside victim environment
  5. Persistence: how the attacker is able to remain inside the victim environment
  6. Privilege Escalation: elevating attacker's level of access in the victim environment
  7. Defense Evasion: how the attacker evades being detected
  8. Credential Access: stealing legitimate user credentials to promote other attacking interests
  9. Discovery: how the attacker gains information about victim environment constitution
  10. Lateral Movement: moving around in the victim environment
  11. Collection: gathering info from victim environment for later exfiltration
  12. Command and Control: attacker communicates with the victim system
  13. Exfiltration: stealing information while staying undetected
  14. Impact: preventing the victim from accessing the victim system
* Each tactic describes a specific behaviour of the threat actor and has a set of techniques
* [ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/#)
  * column headers = tactics
  * column cells = techniques
  * behind gray buttons of the cells = sub-techniques
  * technique page pattern is the same in all techniques
  * good for planning blue/red team exercises, studying threat actors, ...
* [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/)
  * good for visualizing: a threat actor's modus operandi, behaviour of a specific tool, ...
  * preloads the mapping for the tools & groups on layers that the user can then create, combine, overlap
* Example: Formbook
  * Formbook is an infostealer, a browser-logger software that retrieves authorization and login credentials from a web data form before the information reaches a secure server
  * Credential Access: T1555 Credentials from Password Stores (T1555.03 Credentials from Web Browsers), T1056 Input Capture (T1056.001 Keylogging)
  * Collection: T1056 Input Capture (T1056.001 Keylogging)
  * Collection: T1113 Screen Capture

## Answer and reference

In context of [Mitre Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.org/)

### Define tactic

* A specific malevolent behaviour which has a set of techniques ([Costa-Gazc贸n 2021](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-threat-intelligence/9781838556372/B13376_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-75))
* Represents the **WHY** a technique is used; tactic is the objective ([Strom 2018](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-101-17074d3bc62))

### Define technique and subtechnique

* Technique: how adversaries interact with systems during an operation ([Strom 2018](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-101-17074d3bc62))
  * contains information relevant to understanding how the technique works, the context surrounding events, or artifacts generated by the technique
* Represents the **HOW**, or action, of an attack, or **WHAT** is gained by performing an action ([Strom 2018](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-101-17074d3bc62))
* Sub-technique: more specific description of the action (technique)([ATT&CK FAQ](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/faq/))

### Define procedure

* A specific way to implement a specific malevolent technique or sub-technique ([Costa-Gazc贸n 2021](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-threat-intelligence/9781838556372/B13376_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-75))
  * can contain multiple techniques and sub-techniques
* In-the-wild use of techniques ([ATT&CK FAQ](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/faq/))
