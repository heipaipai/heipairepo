## Summarize texts

### [Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)

#### Abstract

The older defense mindset that focuses on covering the vulnerabilities is insufficient against the more persistent attackers who use advanced tools and techniques.
Instead, the authors propose a modified kill chain model to shift the defenders’ mindset towards hindering, and hopefully stopping, the attacks earlier, 
thus causing bigger percentage of attacks to fail. 
Ideally, the new tools will create a feedback loop giving the defenders dynamic information about the tools used against the defended system, 
so that new counters can be devised.

#### Intrusion Kill Chain

The original U.S. military kill chain process against physical targets is modified to better fit computer network attacks or espionage.
1. Reconnaissance: active / passive, some of which can still be through legal means
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command & Control
7. Action on Objectives (target breached)

#### Courses of Action

After the defensive tools align with the attacker tools in each link of the chain, 
the performance and effectiveness of each action can be measured and used by the defenders 
to better understand the attacker's aim and develop more effective tools against them.

### [Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/)

An incomplete cheatsheet of commands introduced:

    $ = user command prompt
    # = comment
    *man = manual
    pwd = print working directory
    ls = list
    cd = move to directory
    . = current directory
    .. = 1 directory up
    *less file.txt = view next page from file.txt
    mkdir dirname = create a new directory
    mv oldname newname = moves the oldname directory to newname, or renames oldname to newname
    cp -r originaldir copydir = recursively copy originaldir to copydir
    rm = remove
    rmdir = remove an empty directory
    rm -r = recursive remove (!!!)
    ssh username@server.com = remote connect securely
    exit = exit from the remote connection

/* not sure whether less is a legit command in Windows terminals, however, there's no "man".

## a) [Bandit oh-five: levels 0-4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

These were quite easy to do once I got the hang of the connections. It took me a while though.
To help with the first two levels, I watched [this Youtube video by SelfTaughtDev](https://youtu.be/2wozdVl3psY) to make sure what I was doing was even remotely correct.

**Please note: To avoid spoiling the games, I am only reporting my progress quite generally.**

### [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

Log into the game? With what? Since the page talked about commands, I supposed the games are played via the command terminal. 
This would also make sense on the scope of the course.

Next I had to figure out the ssh command. In this, [the Youtube video by SelfTaughtDev](https://youtu.be/2wozdVl3psY) helped a lot.

![Screenshot showing the bandit0@bandit user](https://github.com/heipaipai/heipairepo/blob/main/bandit0a.png)

Commands I used:
    
    ssh

### [Level 0 - 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

In here, I needed to find the password for level 1.
That was quite easy, but it took me a while to figure that you were supposed to log out from bandit0 before continuing.
Also, my terminal disliked the copy-paste required here. I made it work with right-clicking.

![Screenshot showing logout from the bandit0 server](https://github.com/heipaipai/heipairepo/blob/3929b89a10d8d6d2b10eb795ab9fe9eec6556dab/bandit01a.png)

Commands I used:

    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 1 - 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

Here I were supposed to read the password for level 2 in a file named '-'.
The odd file name required some additional googling to find [this source](https://www.webservertalk.com/dashed-filename).
The task instructions said that it's in home directory, however, I was apparently logged right into the home directory.

![bandit12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214563306-d5199aad-7c7b-4d3e-8b3d-c07e36d6833a.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 2 - 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

Here I had another weird file name with spaces in it.
This I found easy because of my previous experience with using Git.

![bandit23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214564236-173add50-a7e8-46c6-acec-29b572c4eb4e.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 3 - 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html)

Here the password was hidden.
This, again, was easy since I have learned to use ls with the options that list and show everything in that directory.

![bandit34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214565247-8b72521d-e5b4-40da-a5c7-4b572612e2b2.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cd
    cat
    exit

## b) Bullseye: installing a Debian on a VirtualBox VM

### Debian OS

First, I downloaded the recommended Debian OS according to the instructions given in
[Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/).
After debating the versions, I chose the [debian-live-11.6.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso (WARNING: Link leads to downloading the same ISO!)](https://cdimage.debian.org/images/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-11.6.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso) according to the instructions.

### VirtualBox

Then I moved on to downloading and installing the [VirtualBox 7.0.6 for Windows](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Everything worked smoothly, and the VirtualBox opened up nicely.

![virtualbox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214598716-718d8a91-1cfc-4062-969f-8f99d5e280aa.png) 

### Creation of virtual machine

According to the [instructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/),
I selected Machine - New ... and selected Expert Mode.
It looked pretty different from the screenshots in instructions.

![virtualboxexpertmode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214602710-bd49fc4e-a6cf-4cf2-9192-6d2117fd8df6.png)

I filled in the following information according to the instructions:
* Name and Operating System tab:
    * Name: DebianHeiPai
    * Type: Linux
    * Version: Debian (64-bit)
* Hardware tab:
    * Memory Size: 4000 MB
* Hard Disk tab:
    * Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
    * File size: 60 GB
* Everything else was kept on default as recommended

![virtualboxname](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605505-5b0d03f9-efd9-472c-837c-855e657ac609.png)

![virtualboxhardware](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605739-194a35cb-a0d6-4c27-87ec-2f13d1f83db3.png)

![virtualboxdisk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605918-c94b0493-68ba-42c4-9c64-c5ba6e6b2718.png)

After that I clicked on Finish, since there was no Create, and successfully created a VM.

![virtualboxVM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214606567-ced9fa63-2c35-41c3-b093-b5a1b6865c15.png)

### Inserting Debian ISO into VM

I selected the newly-created VM, clicked Settings and Storage tab.
Selected the empty CD, clicked the tiny CD icon,
and chose the best equivalent to "Virtual Optical Disk File".
Then I clicked Add+, searched the Debian ISO I downloaded earlier and added it.
Then I clicked Choose and OK to close the Settings.

![virtualboxSettingsStorage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214608762-f135dd2a-7a56-4c3e-a253-5499078a1dd7.png)

![virtualboxOpticISO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214610208-96d399f0-1873-4f31-9ed2-62bc3e4bf9fe.png)

![virtualboxVMwISO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214610426-e353aaf6-8ff8-4b33-8482-0031fd278c13.png)

Live version never worked. It just gave me 2 identical messages:

    Failed to send host log message.

What was to be done then?

I don't really know, but I went and installed Debian anyway. That's what VMs are for, right?
There were loads of oddities in the installation: for example, the only way I found to add a Finnish keyboard was to set the language in Finnish, and the partitions...
But it seemed to work; I could log in no problem, and could browse internet with no difficulties.
I will need to download that VirtualBox Guest Addition later.

-!! THIS WILL HAVE TO BE CHECKED DURING THE LESSON. !!-

## c) WebGoat: installing WebGoat practice target

... supposedly on the VM?
But I am not in the sudoers file, so I got reported when trying to install Java on the VM.
There goes my try to install the WebGoat on the VM itself.
Should I install it on my own PC then?
It could be so, however, my cheese brain is giving me alarms.
I have heard that "everything on this course will be contained in the VMs".
But was it for this course?
Cheese brain does not recall.

-!!  THIS WILL HAVE TO BE CHECKED DURING THE LESSON. !!-

## d) WebGoat: solve General: HTTP Basics and General: Developer Tools

## Voluntary: Bandit 5-7

### [Level 4 - 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

Here I had to find and handle a human readable file.
Navigating into the correct directory was easy, but then I hit a wall.
What does "human readable file" mean? It cannot be readable only by humans with today's technology.
Quickly reading a random file showed that at least it wasn't that one.
Resisting the temptation to simply read all the files,
I googled [this blog (SPOILER ALERT!)](https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level5/)
and found the correct command and option to use to find the correct file.

![bandit45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214570525-9bbc5ce9-2cba-49a1-ba12-95fa4d0ab5cd.png)

Commands I used:
    
    ssh
    ls
    cd
    file
    cat
    exit

### [Level 5- 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html)

Here I were given more specs with which to find the correct file.
Faced with the directory of directories, it felt like it was time to use command 'find'.

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cd
    

## [Level 6 -7]()
