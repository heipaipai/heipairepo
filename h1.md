## Summarize texts

### [Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains](https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf)

#### Abstract

The older defense mindset that focuses on covering the vulnerabilities is insufficient against the more persistent attackers who use advanced tools and techniques.
Instead, the authors propose a modified kill chain model to shift the defenders’ mindset towards hindering, and hopefully stopping, the attacks earlier, 
thus causing bigger percentage of attacks to fail. 
Ideally, the new tools will create a feedback loop giving the defenders dynamic information about the tools used against the defended system, 
so that new counters can be devised.

#### Intrusion Kill Chain

The original U.S. military kill chain process against physical targets is modified to better fit computer network attacks or espionage.
1. Reconnaissance: active / passive, some of which can still be through legal means
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command & Control
7. Action on Objectives (target breached)

#### Courses of Action

After the defensive tools align with the attacker tools in each link of the chain, 
the performance and effectiveness of each action can be measured and used by the defenders 
to better understand the attacker's aim and develop more effective tools against them.

### [Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited](https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/)

An incomplete cheatsheet of commands introduced:

    $ = user command prompt
    # = comment
    *man = manual
    pwd = print working directory
    ls = list
    cd = move to directory
    . = current directory
    .. = 1 directory up
    *less file.txt = view next page from file.txt
    mkdir dirname = create a new directory
    mv oldname newname = moves the oldname directory to newname, or renames oldname to newname
    cp -r originaldir copydir = recursively copy originaldir to copydir
    rm = remove
    rmdir = remove an empty directory
    rm -r = recursive remove (!!!)
    ssh username@server.com = remote connect securely
    exit = exit from the remote connection

/* not sure whether less is a legit command in Windows terminals, however, there's no "man".

## a) [Bandit oh-five: levels 0-4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

These were quite easy to do once I got the hang of the connections. It took me a while though.
To help with the first two levels, I watched [this Youtube video by SelfTaughtDev](https://youtu.be/2wozdVl3psY) to make sure what I was doing was even remotely correct.

**Please note: To avoid spoiling the games, I am only reporting my progress quite generally.**

### [Level 0](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

Log into the game? With what? Since the page talked about commands, I supposed the games are played via the command terminal. 
This would also make sense on the scope of the course.

Next I had to figure out the ssh command. In this, [the Youtube video by SelfTaughtDev](https://youtu.be/2wozdVl3psY) helped a lot.

![Screenshot showing OverTheWire bandit game server welcome banner](https://github.com/heipaipai/heipairepo/blob/main/bandit0.png)

![Screenshot showing the bandit0@bandit user](https://github.com/heipaipai/heipairepo/blob/main/bandit0a.png)

Commands I used:
    
    ssh

### [Level 0 - 1](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

In here, I needed to find the password for level 1.
That was quite easy, but it took me a while to figure that you were supposed to log out from bandit0 before continuing.
Also, my terminal disliked the copy-paste required here. I made it work with right-clicking.

![Screenshot showing logout from the bandit0 server](https://github.com/heipaipai/heipairepo/blob/3929b89a10d8d6d2b10eb795ab9fe9eec6556dab/bandit01a.png)

Commands I used:

    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 1 - 2](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

Here I were supposed to read the password for level 2 in a file named '-'.
The odd file name required some additional googling to find [this source](https://www.webservertalk.com/dashed-filename).
The task instructions said that it's in home directory, however, I was apparently logged right into the home directory.

![bandit12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214563306-d5199aad-7c7b-4d3e-8b3d-c07e36d6833a.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 2 - 3](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html)

Here I had another weird file name with spaces in it.
This I found easy because of my previous experience with using Git.

![bandit23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214564236-173add50-a7e8-46c6-acec-29b572c4eb4e.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cat
    exit

### [Level 3 - 4](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit4.html)

Here the password was hidden.
This, again, was easy since I have learned to use ls with the options that list and show everything in that directory.

![bandit34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214565247-8b72521d-e5b4-40da-a5c7-4b572612e2b2.png)

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cd
    cat
    exit

## b) Bullseye: installing a Debian on a VirtualBox VM

### Debian OS

First, I downloaded the recommended Debian OS according to the instructions given in
[Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/).
After debating the versions, I chose the [debian-live-11.6.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso (WARNING: Link leads to downloading the same ISO!)](https://cdimage.debian.org/images/unofficial/non-free/images-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-11.6.0-amd64-xfce+nonfree.iso) according to the instructions.

### VirtualBox

Then I moved on to downloading and installing the [VirtualBox 7.0.6 for Windows](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
Everything worked smoothly, and the VirtualBox opened up nicely.

![virtualbox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214598716-718d8a91-1cfc-4062-969f-8f99d5e280aa.png) 

### Creation of virtual machine

According to the [instructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/),
I selected Machine - New ... and selected Expert Mode.
It looked pretty different from the screenshots in instructions.

![virtualboxexpertmode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214602710-bd49fc4e-a6cf-4cf2-9192-6d2117fd8df6.png)

I filled in the following information according to the instructions:
* Name and Operating System tab:
    * Name: DebianHeiPai
    * Type: Linux
    * Version: Debian (64-bit)
* Hardware tab:
    * Memory Size: 4000 MB
* Hard Disk tab:
    * Hard disk: Create a virtual hard disk now
    * File size: 60 GB
* Everything else was kept on default as recommended

![virtualboxname](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605505-5b0d03f9-efd9-472c-837c-855e657ac609.png)

![virtualboxhardware](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605739-194a35cb-a0d6-4c27-87ec-2f13d1f83db3.png)

![virtualboxdisk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214605918-c94b0493-68ba-42c4-9c64-c5ba6e6b2718.png)

After that I clicked on Finish, since there was no Create, and successfully created a VM.

![virtualboxVM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214606567-ced9fa63-2c35-41c3-b093-b5a1b6865c15.png)

### Inserting Debian ISO into VM

I selected the newly-created VM, clicked Settings and Storage tab.
Selected the empty CD, clicked the tiny CD icon,
and chose the best equivalent to "Virtual Optical Disk File".
Then I clicked Add+, searched the Debian ISO I downloaded earlier and added it.
Then I clicked Choose and OK to close the Settings.

![virtualboxSettingsStorage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214608762-f135dd2a-7a56-4c3e-a253-5499078a1dd7.png)

![virtualboxOpticISO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214610208-96d399f0-1873-4f31-9ed2-62bc3e4bf9fe.png)

![virtualboxVMwISO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214610426-e353aaf6-8ff8-4b33-8482-0031fd278c13.png)

### Booting to Desktop

It was time to boot to Desktop.
I originally tried to do this thrice, with no success.
The screenshots are from the latest attempt on 25th Jan 21.30.

Double-clicked the VM on VirtualBox to power it up.
Power-up went fine. Bootloader appeared.

![installer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214667220-8badf3c8-233a-476d-b58f-614113b4bb96.png)

I chose to boot to live as per the instructions. This never worked before.
At first, the error messages looked familiar.

![installererror](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214668192-1c460725-7ff4-4e21-b06f-b49b8e9e2a0f.png)

However, this was the first time I got to see this kind of a screen!

![installerlogin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214668625-ed718bd0-eabd-4ee6-99a8-b328cc282e5b.png)

Unfortunately, the new screen flashed past and became the very familiar black screen.

![installerblackscreen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214668937-42fb9b59-54d8-40f8-bc1d-a53e4eca13ae.png)

After a couple reboots with the exact same results, 
I remembered the instructions on how to solve a black screen with xforcevesa.
Reboot + esc brought me the following:

![installerboot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214669585-f6603b65-76ce-4aee-8a3c-2264308e6a9c.png)

Which, again, looked nothing like the instructions. But what is this screen?
After trying reboot + esc with this result a couple times,
I tried the alt-ctrl-F1 option to bring up a text mode console.
Apparently, the earlier mentioned New Screen was this text mode console.
However, I could find no way to update anything even after rigorous googling.
The help looked like following:

![installertextconsolehelp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214670624-90b723a3-add0-4baf-861f-63d392458878.png)

After a couple more tries, I gave up on getting the live boot to work.
I had managed to install a somewhat working Debian earlier without any live boot proofing,
so I hoped this nth time would do the charm.

### Installing Debian

![installergraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214671309-d4b1c489-4af7-4fa1-9482-cf94a1fb4db6.png)

I had been here before and knew that the graphic installer would look nothing like
the one in Karvinen's instructions.
I looked through some guides and decided on [this one](https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-debian-11-bullseye-on-virtualbox/) in hopes it would help me through this.

Next follows 17 screenshots of every single screen during the graphic installation I got:

![installergraph01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214672489-88b705a9-7090-47a1-a29f-2b25828539e0.png)

There's less than half of the screenshots left! You can do it!

![installergraph10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214673278-f14ffd27-0448-42c7-96d6-85bee4aa94d9.png)

![installergraph16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214673791-d60a3aa4-e798-4fe8-9474-00bf0fc9e642.png)

![installergraph17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214673851-701db6ea-bc78-4d83-b648-94b6757456f1.png)

And that was it! Then I waited and took notes as the VM worked.
After some time, I came back to this:

![installergraph18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214675033-1b271387-9d3e-4d65-9eba-349a1dd98fa8.png)

Even though I had a working internet connection on my laptop,
I chose no, since it seemed the simpler option for now.

![installergraph19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214676467-921d0f53-278d-4f14-b494-d0d6b50c919c.png)

![installergraph20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214676511-0236791e-9e7f-46a1-bcab-c537cb7a305f.png)

Then some more waiting as the installation finished.
By the time I had the login screen in front of me, it was 22.15.
Right before the login screen, the installation showed me some
very scarily familiar screens:
the Debian GNU/Linux GRUB screen from [Karvinen's instructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/#solve-a-black-screen-with-xforcevesa-optional) that I didn't manage to capture,
and:

![installergraph22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214680752-71873395-837e-42e6-9437-0c04a42c9aa6.png)

But finally I saw the login screen.

![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214682332-6780d565-1c8c-4121-8014-1db109e5db16.png)

### First log in

Unlike in the screenshot, I logged in with root user to be sure I 
get access to everything I need. First, I checked that the internet 
worked. Apparently having chosen no mirrors in the installation didn't
stop the internet connection, for which I'm happy.

![check01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214682444-1138add0-b52f-4945-8c44-dd33e3dddafb.png)

Then I opened the terminal and ran each line one at a time:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade

This was actually where I was left before, since I weren't allowed
to use sudo earlier due to some network reasons that I can no longer
remember.

I also logged in again during the updating and began installing firewall.
However, there appeared a problem with the ufw packages.

![check03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214685583-eaa804cb-0a4d-43aa-b5c8-20d8fbd06232.png)

According to [this source](https://www.nixcraft.com/t/e-package-ufw-has-no-installation-candidate-on-debian-linux/3726), I only needed to update the package database and try again.

    sudo apt update / sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install ufw

No cigar, ufw still had no installation candidate.
Since [this user on Kali](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/596035/package-ufw-is-not-available-but-is-referred-to-by-another-package) had encountered the same problem and it had had something to do with something in file

    /etc/apt/sources.list
    
I decided to navigate in there to have a look with my brand-new cat skills.

![ufw01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214693851-64905916-4932-4324-83e8-9fc72d53fe18.png)

![ufw02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214693870-568df88d-d099-4d37-a087-2ca22aaefa0e.png)

So this comes down to the mirrors I didn't configure during install? I do not know.
By this time the clock is 23.25 and I had to give in for today.


















## c) WebGoat: installing WebGoat practice target

... supposedly on the VM?
But I am not in the sudoers file, so I got reported when trying to install Java on the VM.
There goes my try to install the WebGoat on the VM itself.
Should I install it on my own PC then?
It could be so, however, my cheese brain is giving me alarms.
I have heard that "everything on this course will be contained in the VMs".
But was it for this course?
Cheese brain does not recall.

## d) WebGoat: solve General: HTTP Basics and General: Developer Tools

## Voluntary: Bandit 5-7

### [Level 4 - 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

Here I had to find and handle a human readable file.
Navigating into the correct directory was easy, but then I hit a wall.
What does "human readable file" mean? It cannot be readable only by humans with today's technology.
Quickly reading a random file showed that at least it wasn't that one.
Resisting the temptation to simply read all the files,
I googled [this blog (SPOILER ALERT!)](https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level5/)
and found the correct command and option to use to find the correct file.

![bandit45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/214570525-9bbc5ce9-2cba-49a1-ba12-95fa4d0ab5cd.png)

Commands I used:
    
    ssh
    ls
    cd
    file
    cat
    exit

### [Level 5- 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html)

Here I were given more specs with which to find the correct file.
Faced with the directory of directories, it felt like it was time to use command 'find'.

Commands I used:

    ssh
    ls
    cd
