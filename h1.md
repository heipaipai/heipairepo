### Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

#### Abstract

The older defense mindset that focuses on covering the vulnerabilities is insufficient against the more persistent attackers who use advanced tools and techniques.
Instead, the authors propose a modified kill chain model to shift the defendersâ€™ mindset towards hindering, and hopefully stopping, the attacks earlier, 
thus causing bigger percentage of attacks to fail. 
Ideally, the new tools will create a feedback loop giving the defenders dynamic information about the tools used against the defended system, 
so that new counters can be devised.

#### Intrusion Kill Chain

The original U.S. military kill chain process against physical targets is modified to better fit computer network attacks or espionage.
1. Reconnaissance, 2. Weaponization, 3. Delivery, 4. Exploitation, 5. Installation, 6. Command & Control, and 7. Action on Objectives (target breached).

#### Courses of Action

After the defensive tools align with the attacker tools in each link of the chain, 
the performance and effectiveness of each action can be measured and used by the defenders 
to better understand the attacker's aim and develop more effective tools against them.

### Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

An incomplete cheatsheet of commands introduced:

    $ = user command prompt
    # = comment
    *man = manual
    pwd = print working directory
    ls = list
    cd = move to directory
    . = current directory
    .. = 1 directory up
    *less file.txt = view next page from file.txt
    mkdir dirname = create a new directory
    mv oldname newname = moves the oldname directory to newname, or renames oldname to newname
    cp -r originaldir copydir = recursively copy originaldir to copydir
    rm = remove
    rmdir = remove an empty directory
    rm -r = recursive remove (!!!)
    ssh username@server.com = remote connect securely
    exit = exit from the remote connection

/* not sure whether less is a legit command in Windows terminals, however, there's no "man".

## a) Bandit oh-five: levels 0-4

These were quite easy to do once I got the hang of the connections. It took me a while though.

## b) Bullseye: installing a Debian on a VirtualBox VM

Live version never worked. It just gave me 2 identical messages:

    Failed to send host log message.

What was to be done then?

I don't really know, but I went and installed Debian anyway. That's what VMs are for, right?
There were loads of oddities in the installation: for example, the only way I found to add a Finnish keyboard was to set the language in Finnish, and the partitions...
But it seemed to work; I could log in no problem, and could browse internet with no difficulties.
I will need to download that VirtualBox Guest Addition later.

-!! THIS WILL HAVE TO BE CHECKED DURING THE LESSON. !!-

## c) WebGoat: installing WebGoat practice target

... supposedly on the VM?
But I am not in the sudoers file, so I got reported when trying to install Java on the VM.
There goes my try to install the WebGoat on the VM itself.
Should I install it on my own PC then?
It could be so, however, my cheese brain is giving me alarms.
I have heard that "everything on this course will be contained in the VMs".
But was it for this course?
Cheese brain does not recall.

## d) WebGoat: solve General: HTTP Basics and General: Developer Tools

I did not do these exercises.
