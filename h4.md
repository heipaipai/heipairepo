### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/)

#### [2.3 One-Way Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

One-way function
* Fundamental building block for most of cryptography(?) protocols
* Central to public-key cryptography
* Relatively easy to compute, significantly harder to reverse
  * given _x_, it is easy to compute _f(x)_
  * given _f(x)_, it is hard (impossible with current technology) to compute _x_
* No mathematical proof of one-way functions actually existing nor any real evidence on their construction
  * many functions seem enough like one-way functions so this text considers them as such

Use of one-way functions
* Can't be used for encryption as-is since the encrypted message can't be decrypted
* Trapdoor one-way function
  * a special type fo one-way functions
  * given _f(x)_ and the secret _y_, it is easy to compute _x_

#### [2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec004)

Also known as
* Compression function
* Contraction function
* Message digest
* Fingerprint
* Cryptographic checksum
* Message integrity check (MIC)
* Manipulation detection code (MDC)

Hash functions (not one-way)
* Mathematical or other function that takes a _pre-image_ and converts it to _hash value_
  * pre-image = variable-length string input
  * hash value = fixed length string output, usually smaller than pre-image
* Take the pre-image and creates a hash byte that is a XOR of all input bytes
  * XOR = e**x**clusive **OR**, basically works like the linguistic or (either-or) instead of the logic OR (as long as at least one is true, OR = true)
* The hash value is not unique but a reasonably accurate fingerprint of the pre-image
  * the hash can be computed into a set of pre-images rather easily
* Public function, no secrecy implemented in it

One-way hash functions
* Central to modern cryptography
* Again, it is easy to compute a hash value from a pre-image, but it's hard to compute the correct pre-image from its hash value
* Collision-free: generating more than one pre-images that give out the same hash is hard
* Output of a one-way hash function is not dependent on the pre-image in a discernible way
  * this is the source of security
  * one bit difference in pre-images changes on average half of the bits in the hash value
* Easy to verify known pre-images by their hashes

Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
* Also known as: Data Authentication Code (DAC)
* One-way hash function + secret key
* Both the pre-image and the secret key are hashed
  * only someone with the same secret key can verify the hash value
* Created from hash functions or block encryption algorithms
* Dedicated MACs exist
