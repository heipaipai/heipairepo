## Summarize texts

### [Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/)

#### [2.3 One-Way Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

One-way function
* Fundamental building block for most of cryptography(?) protocols
* Central to public-key cryptography
* Relatively easy to compute, significantly harder to reverse
  * given _x_, it is easy to compute _f(x)_
  * given _f(x)_, it is hard (impossible with current technology) to compute _x_
* No mathematical proof of one-way functions actually existing nor any real evidence on their construction
  * many functions seem enough like one-way functions so this text considers them as such

Use of one-way functions
* Can't be used for encryption as-is since the encrypted message can't be decrypted
* Trapdoor one-way function
  * a special type fo one-way functions
  * given _f(x)_ and the secret _y_, it is easy to compute _x_

#### [2.4 One-Way Hash Functions](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec004)

Also known as
* Compression function
* Contraction function
* Message digest
* Fingerprint
* Cryptographic checksum
* Message integrity check (MIC)
* Manipulation detection code (MDC)

Hash functions (not one-way)
* Mathematical or other function that takes a _pre-image_ and converts it to _hash value_
  * pre-image = variable-length string input
  * hash value = fixed length string output, usually smaller than pre-image
* Take the pre-image and creates a hash byte that is a XOR of all input bytes
  * XOR = e**x**clusive **OR**, basically works like the linguistic or (either-or) instead of the logic OR (as long as at least one is true, OR = true)
* The hash value is not unique but a reasonably accurate fingerprint of the pre-image
  * the hash can be computed into a set of pre-images rather easily
* Public function, no secrecy implemented in it

One-way hash functions
* Central to modern cryptography
* Again, it is easy to compute a hash value from a pre-image, but it's hard to compute the correct pre-image from its hash value
* Collision-free: generating more than one pre-images that give out the same hash is hard
* Output of a one-way hash function is not dependent on the pre-image in a discernible way
  * this is the source of security
  * one bit difference in pre-images changes on average half of the bits in the hash value
* Easy to verify known pre-images by their hashes

Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
* Also known as: Data Authentication Code (DAC)
* One-way hash function + secret key
* Both the pre-image and the secret key are hashed
  * only someone with the same secret key can verify the hash value
* Created from hash functions or block encryption algorithms
* Dedicated MACs exist

## Install Hashcat

Instructions: [Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

This task was actually done during the 8.2.2023 lecture, 
and since I didn't know back then this would become a task,
I of course did not take any screenshots of the process.

## Crack hash

The hash to be cracked:

    8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f

Began task 14.2.23 at 22.04.

According to the [nstructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/),
I first identified the hash type.

![crack-hash-cat01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/218850426-047587c6-eb83-4649-bb5d-d10814c5bd00.png)

That was a lot of options.
I picked MD5 for the first try because it had been the one used until now.
First I navigated to the 'hashed' directory, where I had my rockyou.txt.

    cd hashed

Then I ran the command to crack the hash:

    hashcat -m 0 '8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f' rockyou.txt
    
After a moment of waiting, I got the result:

![crack-hash-cat02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/218851833-6a34d278-9db2-41cc-bf68-dbcdea3fc821.png)

I was a bit disappointed, since all the hashes until now had indeed been MD5.
I had hoped this task would require going into some of the other hash functions.

Ended task 14.2.2023 at 22.16.

## Compile John the Ripper Jumbo

Instructions: [Karvinen 2023: Crack File Password With John](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/)

Began task 14.2.2023 at 22.18.

First, I installed the recommended prerequisites as recommended in the instructions.
This was when I finally installed the micro text editor recommended to me by Tero as well.
Talk about being late...

Then I cloned [the John Jumbo git repository](https://github.com/openwall/john)
as per instructions, with --depth=1.

![john-the-ripper01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/218854536-5a309294-b887-4dd0-8a0e-e5a3d3201f6f.png)

Also ran a

    ls -laF
    
inside the john/src/.
Boy, was there stuff innit!
Most of the stuff I had never heard of,
but I did get a glimpse of a bunch of MD5 related files,
and then remembered that Tero had told on lecture 8.2.2023
something about these being the actual decryptors or something.

Ran the ./configure.
Lots of checking and configuring later it was apparently configured.

Time to compile with the 'make -s clean && make -sj4'.
At first, nothing happened. Suspicioussssss.
Once the first lines appeared, it became clear that this indeed was not a quick move.
After 5+ minutes, it did finish somehow.

Ended task 14.2.2023 at 22.48.

## Crack a zip file password

Alright, this task required a password-secured zip file.
Were we supposed to use the one in [the instructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/)?
I didn't see any other zip files and didn't want to create one, so I went with [that (WARNING: link starts the download!)](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/tero.zip).

Began task 14.2.2023 at 22.52.

First of all, I downloaded the zip file.
Then I extracted the hash into the separate file as per instructions.
It gave me a weird note about the secretFiles inside the zip not being encrypted,
so I took a look in the extracted hash.

![crack-zip01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/218861507-38d1705f-5ad1-4c4f-b55b-2e57352b23c4.png)

It was obviously a hash as expected, 
so I was right when I remembered something about the secretFiles not being encrypted but the zip itself being encrypted or something like that.

Time to run the dictionary attack against the hash.

![crack-zip02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/218862202-79043add-82dc-4adb-828b-e4d1b97c894e.png)

John was fast, I barely managed to see it running before it was done.
I wanted to continue exploring John, 
since I tend to like tools with a myriad applications like John,
but the day ran out.
Happy Valentine's Day!
