### [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/): [Episode 126: REvil](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/126/)
* REvil was a ransomware as a service (RaaS), and the group behind, active between April 2019 and January 2022.
* Preceded by a ransomware-turned-to-RaaS GandCrab
  * Ransomware Mechanisms of Action: get into a target company, spread around in inner network, encrypt the victim's machines, demand ransom, if paid, provide a decryption key, if not paid, leak the stolen information
  * GandCrab people learned that it was easier to sell GandCrab as a service to other people ("associates"/clients) who took care of the Cyber Kill Chain steps until delivery and Installation of the malware for a share of the paid ransoms
  * REvil was built straight into a RaaS but was sometimes used independently by the REvil themselves at times
* REvil features
  * Encrypt (& decrypt) machines
  * Locate and delete victim backups
  * Ransom negotiation and means to transfer and launder received Bitcoins into useable money via darknet chats, payment sites etc
  * Steal and leak victim data on Tor website called Happy Blog
  * Use victim's own machines to DDoS the victim and the victim's partners
  * Chooses valid targets by checking the machine language and country settings and not executing on machines that are registered to Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) members list
* The people behind were Russian-speaking, Russian nationality
  * Unknown: pretty much the early frontman of REvil, originally a guy who posted on underground forums about REvil and gave online interviews, claiming to be part of REvil
* Known victims
  * 16 Aug 2019: Texas government, ransom $2.3 million, didn't pay
  * May 2020: GSM Law, ransom $42 million, result unknown (REvil apologised)
  * 1 Jun 2021: JBS USA, ransom $11 mission, paid the ransom
  * Sol Oriens
  * 2 Jul 2021?: Kaseya (& 1500 of Kaseya customer companies), ransom $70 million, didn't pay
  * Customers of ransomware insurance companies via the insurance company itself
  * 282 companies' data leaked to their site for not paying the ransom
* Endgame
  * Kaseya contacted FBI as soon as they noticed they had been attacked
  * FBI advised Kaseya's responses (did not pay), mapped the affected customers of Kaseya's, did FBI magic, obtained a decryption key and used it to save as many companies as possible
  * All REvil servers go offline
  * 11 Aug 2021?: US Justice Department indicts and releases a photo of Yaroslav Vasinskyi / Robotnik
  * 8 Oct 2021?: Vasinskyi arrested in Poland and extradited to the US
  * US Justice Department seized $6.1 million from Yevgeniy Polyanin and releases his photo
  * Jan 14? 2022: Russian FSB told in press release they arrested 14 members of REvil including alleged ringleader Roman Muromsky, and Andrei Bessonov in Moscow and St. Petersburg, seized millions of Rubles, vehicles and technology; the information can't be verified

## a) Sequel

Solved the given tasks from [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).
I have studied some SQL before so these were easy.
I must admit that studying SQL this way might've been more fun than the way I did it, but the milk's spilled.
Please note that I will show the least amount of the exercises in order to not spoil the learning from others.

### [0 SELECT basics](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics)

Began task 3.2.23 at 15.26.

1. Show population of Germany

![sqlzoo-basics01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216615153-7aa15de3-bdc3-4b6f-acdf-78d523476ddb.png)

2. Show the name and population of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

Loved how they accurately named the actual Scandinavian countries.
No, Finland is not a Scandinavian country.
Bringing us into the Scandinavian mix would get you Fenno-Scandinavia.
Check out [this awesome comic](https://satwcomic.com/how-the-north-works) that proves it.
I'm digressing.

![sqlzoo-basics02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216616910-cc3616e5-92aa-407f-b662-6d3a821a5ffb.png)

3. Display countries whose area is 200k-250k sq km.

![sqlzoo-basics03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216617466-b3770027-79ee-4a7b-8e3a-3a81f809a813.png)

Ended task 3.2.23 at 15.40.
(Looking for the correct comic took me way too much time.)

### [2 SELECT from World 1-5](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial)

Began task 3.2.23 at 15.41.

1. Show name, continent and population of all countries.

Observed since they had the correct SQL there all along.
Understandably, I didn't screenshoot the whole table.

![sqlzoo-world01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216618275-8d59f173-b9bf-4eb6-958e-cf68dff7f730.png)

2. Show name of the countries whose population >= 200 million.

There are 8 zeros in a 200 million: 200 000 000.

![sqlzoo-world02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216618712-981dc2f9-fc22-4e2b-b605-939518bc6a6e.png)

3. Show name and per capita GDP for countries whose population >= 200 million.

Per capita GDP = GDP / population.

![sqlzoo-world03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216619266-1f2e88c9-a709-40eb-b910-cb6d68c717ac.png)

4. Show name and population (in millions) for the countries in South America.

There are 6 zeros in 1 million: 1 000 000.

![sqlzoo-world04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216619948-a0a55193-460f-4bd1-895f-24ec0532e3b1.png)

5. Show the name and population for France, Germany and Italy.

![sqlzoo-world05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216620518-285a1f57-e759-45c8-a3b5-c13774668ac5.png)

## b) Injected: WebGoat A1 Injection (intro)

AKA _SQL and how to manipulate it to do hostile tasks_.
**PLEASE NOTE: This section of report contains SPOILERS of the tasks.**

Began task 3.2.23 at 16.08.

**Notes**
* SQL = Structured Query Language = a standardized programming language for managing relational databases and the data in them
  * SQL has 3 types of commands and each type can be used to violate the main protection goals in information security (CIA = Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)
* DML = Data Manipulation Language
  * deals with the manipulation of data
  * used to request / add / delete / modify a result set from / to / in database tables
  * uses the most common SQL commands SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  * attacks using DML violate Confidentiality and Integrity of the data
* DLL = Data Definition Language
  * deals with defining the data structures, especially database schemas
  * uses SQL commands CREATE, ALTER, DROP
  * attacks using DLL violate Integrity and Availability of the data
* DCL = Data Control Language
  * deals with creating user privileges
  * uses SQL commands GRANT, REVOKE
  * attacks using DCL violate Confidentiality and Availability of the data
  
SQL injection
* Most common web hacking technique
* Inserts (= injects) malicious code into the application via a SQL query user input
* Uses SQL metacharacters like -- and ;
* This is why the user inputs have to be filtered __always__
* Successful injection can
  * read and modify data in the database
  * execute admin operations on the database
  * recover the content of a file in the DMBS file system
  * issue commands to OS
* Successful injection leads to attacks like spoofing identity, 
tampering with data, 
leaking and/or destroying data, ...
* Attack is limited by
  * attacker's skill and imagination
  * deployed defences
  * database technology
* Not all databases are equal
  * some databases don't support command chaining: Microsoft Access, MySQL Connector/J and C, and Oracle
  * command shell and registry commands
* SQL injection more common in older languages that don't provide parameterized query support
  * examples: PHP, Classic ASP, Cold Fusion
  * newer versions support parameterized queries

**Tasks**

1. Show the department of Bob Franco.

![webgoat-a1-intro01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216624976-94911ce3-0564-4a6f-8ce4-43aa49d88253.png)

2. Update Tobi Barnett's department to Sales.

I apparently forgot [how to use UPDATE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp).

![webgoat-a1-intro02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216627272-59fea130-2039-4bcf-86f8-088a9a00bac7.png)

3. Add phone (varchar(20)) to employees table.

Also forgot [how to use ALTER TABLE](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alter.asp).

![webgoat-a1-intro03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216628824-53ef1dc7-3ad7-43d0-a213-8e30cd531473.png)

4. Grant usergroup UnauthorizedUser the right to alter tables.

I hadn't [granted or revoked rights in SQL](https://beginner-sql-tutorial.com/sql-grant-revoke-privileges-roles.htm) before.

![webgoat-a1-intro04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216630304-79362031-f55d-4287-8e18-fd6fd2e062f0.png)

5. Test how the SQL query changes with the input in the Username field

![webgoat-a1-intro05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216631768-a364cc2b-1010-4369-bd99-9caf00622794.png)

6. Get all the users from the users table

![webgoat-a1-intro06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216635259-45ed0731-71d3-4b1e-b02f-74164adfc682.png)

7. Figure out which field is susceptible to SQL injection and retrieve all data from users table

I had no clue how to recognise any susceptible fields.
My first instinct was to open Web Developer Tools because it felt like a hacker thing to do.
I inspected the Network.
It helped none.

![webgoat-a1-intro07a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216637640-c458dc85-a905-4651-b650-2226ac9c0b48.png)

Then I inspected the elements of the two fields.

![webgoat-a1-intro07b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216638061-1824c5a1-b6a6-4089-82da-9c7637cb0f35.png)

The two fields' types were different.
Were I onto something here?
What's up with the TEXT type?
I asked Google-sensei.
Google-sensei told me I only ask wrong questions.
Ah, whatever. I didn't want to search for the correct answer yet.
I decided that input type TEXT is weird, so it must be the susceptible one.

![webgoat-a1-intro07c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216639757-4ac9a009-2cb8-4286-916e-d7420ff51b3e.png)

Thankfully, the WebGoat creators had taken newbie learners into account and used a specific error message.
Something even I knew would be a red flag security-wise.
I wondered whether I could've just typed the 1'='1 into both fields right from the beginning,
but that was a question for later.

The problem was, I didn't really understand the error message.
What I understood was that the error was the = in the second input field.
Did this mean that my hunch about the userid field being the susceptible one was wrong?
To gain more information on the fields, I did a series of tests.

![webgoat-a1-intro07d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216643400-162a9662-da31-4258-879e-4a73b1731283.png)

Alright, so login count was a number.

![webgoat-a1-intro07e](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216643539-9038bb9c-6253-4d81-b616-785c2df87653.png)

![webgoat-a1-intro07f](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216643592-c502fef2-a7b5-4e7c-aa85-6907ee066174.png)

Still lost.
What I knew about the fields at this point:

* Login_Count
  * input type text
  * has to be able to be parsed into a number
* User_Id
  * input type TEXT
  * giving it numbers results in 'parameter not set'

I had no clue how to proceed, so I asked Google-sensei.
[This user](https://www.arbexam.blog/webgoat-sql-injection-intro/)
had logiced the same things in much less space, and they made it work with just

    1 or 1=1

without any 's involved.
So I used the same.

![webgoat-a1-intro07g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216647862-68cfd0f0-4f7d-42b2-a01c-8a1a11db3c3c.png)

It worked. How boring.

Took a break from 17.54 to 18.01.

8. Be a nosey employee Smith and get the data of who earns what in your company.

Alright. In the 7th task I used 's where I didn't need them.
This time I examined the example SQL query given more closely before typing in my attempt.

![webgoat-a1-intro08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216651116-7ad2c185-9554-4f69-81d2-7c3a9f107d7d.png)

9. Go and modify your own salary as the Smith.

So chaining commands.
Didn't figure it out before I had to take another break from 18.22 to 23.51.

Back from the break, I checked everyone's salaries and figured out one thing that was wrong.
In that one move I tried before going on break, I had indeed updated the salary.
For everyone.
I gave salaries of 100k to everyone.
Equality!

![webgoat-a1-intro09a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216719639-a00a9fde-7802-48df-aaf7-e07536da9fc4.png)

Whoops.
After that, I remembered to WHERE on John Smith like a proper immoral thief.
Made a late-night error and forgot a = from salary = 110k.

![webgoat-a1-intro09b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216720283-97d49005-8fbf-4749-887e-9871c05e7669.png)

Well, I hope my coworkers were happy for their unexpected pay raise.

10. Delete the access log.

First tried drop table, didn't work.

![webgoat-a1-intro10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216720863-71c40ff5-5754-4b9f-ac98-ab9dec1ea594.png)

Oof, felt stupid.
Of course plain SQL didn't get injected.
Let's blame the number in the clock.

![webgoat-a1-intro10a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55014633/216721305-9715f35d-c2c5-4dd8-914f-525c55ee411b.png)

Well, that looked better.
